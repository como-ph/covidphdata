\description{
The Philippines Department of Health currently distributes the latest data
drop via a fixed shortened URL (\url{bit.ly/DataDropPH})
which links/points to a new Google Drive endpoint daily or whenever the
daily updated data drop is available. This Google Drive endpoint is a
\strong{README} document in portable document format (PDF) which contains a
privacy and confidentiality statement, technical notes with regard to the
latest data, technical notes with regard to previous (archive data) and two
shortened URLs - one linking to the Google Drive folder that contains all
the latest officially released datasets, and the other linking to the
datasets released previously (archives). Of these, the first shortend URL
linking to the Google Drive folder containing the latest officially relased
datasets is different for everyday and can only be obtained through the
\strong{README} document released for a specific day.
}
\details{
The function \code{\link[=datadrop_latest_id]{datadrop_latest_id()}} reads that PDF file, extracts the
shortened URL for the latest official released datasets written in that file,
expands that shortened URL and then extracts the unique Google Drive ID for
the latest officially released datasets. With this Google Drive ID, other
functions can then be used to retrieve information and data from the Google
Drive specified by this ID.

The DoH Data Drop archives, on the other hand, is distributed via a fixed
shortened URL (\href{https://bit.ly/DataDropArchives}{bit.ly/DataDropArchives})
which links/points to a Google Drive folder containing the previous Data Drop
releases.

The function \code{\link[=datadrop_archive_id]{datadrop_archive_id()}} expands that shortened URL and then
extracts the unique Google Drive ID for the DoH Data Drop archives folder.
With this Google Drive ID, other functions can then be used to retrieve
information and data from the Google Drive specified by this ID.
